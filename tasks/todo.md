# Todo: Grammar Review for about.js

## Task Overview
Simple grammatical fixes only - NO content changes. Keep tone, messaging, and overall content exactly the same.

## Grammatical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Article Error (Line 15)
- **Current**: "as an software engineer"
- **Fix**: "as a software engineer"
- **Reason**: "Software" starts with a consonant sound, requires "a" not "an"

### Issue 2: Preposition Error (Line 17)
- **Current**: "with the most cost-effective way"
- **Fix**: "in the most cost-effective way"
- **Reason**: Standard English usage - we do something "in" a way, not "with" a way

## Todo Items
- [x] Fix article error: "an software" → "a software"
- [x] Fix preposition: "with the most" → "in the most"

## Implementation
Two simple word replacements in the paragraphs array.
