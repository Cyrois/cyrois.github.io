This collaborative approach ensures we're building the right features that truly serve the business needs.","From a technical standpoint, I managed 7 different web applications, built 2 from scratch and sunset 3 of them.

I had the opportunity to wear many hats; business analyst, product owner, and developer. This role required both technical expertise and strong project management skills to deliver enterprise solutions.","I can proudly say that I played a pivotal role in launching a custom e-commerce platform for 3 distinct clients: Teleflex, United Farmers Association and Santa Cruz Bicycles. Each having their own unique set of requirements and complex deployment plans.","I worked closely with key stakeholders to convert vague asks into clear business requirements. My analytical skill and managerial skills were critical in developing a project roadmap and creating well-defined user stories, as our development team was located across the world. My primary role(s) was product owner/business analyst, demonstrating and training our clients on our solutions in an effort to get rapid feedback. Albeit, I loved helping the team implement features whenever I had spare time.","A key takeaway from my time at Vass was learning how to talk to key stakeholders.

I worked across the full stack to deliver secure financial applications, one application was a gift card storage and marketplace app called Moola and the other was a Bitcoin Wallet called Stash.","I worked in a team of 4 developers (2 full-stack and 2 mobile) to develop a gift card marketplace and storage application in 1 year that had the ability to work completely offline. Moola was built with Angular, Gulp, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. I also created a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to facilitate automated testing and deployment with the click of a button, significantly improving our development velocity. Moola generated $10,000 in revenue in the first month after launch, demonstrating the business value of well-executed technical work.","Additionally, when the company hadn't been able to hire a C developer, I jumped into our Crypto team to help build a Bitcoin Wallet. I learned how the Bitcoin blockchain worked and customized two open-source libraries, Electrum Wallet and Unstoppable Wallet. With another Kotlin developer, we launched our own Bitcoin Wallet on the Google Play Store within 7 months.","A key takeaway from my time at Moola was that I had the ability to learn any technology. Every technology I used at Moola was new to me, but I was able to pick them up and learn the ropes in no time.

Each application served different business needs, from policy configuration to customer-facing sales portals.","One personal experience at TuGo stands out to me; about a time I found that an API was intermittently dropping data whilst the senior developer was firm that it was working as expected. For days, I tried different payloads, asked others for ideas, debugged with the author, nothing. Until one day, I sifted through the server logs and found that Apache was the culprit. Apache was limiting the payload size by magically dropping packets and proceeding without failure, a 'bug' that no one had even considered, was solved with just a simple configuration value. It was a revolutionary moment for me, at that moment I knew I would become a Senior Engineer if I could think of where to look where none of my peers would.","My contributions were recognized when I was awarded the 2017 Employee of the Year award, highlighting both my technical skills and my ability to deliver value to the business.
