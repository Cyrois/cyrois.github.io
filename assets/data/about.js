    "What I've learned throughout my career after working across multiple industries with several different teams: it's all about adding value. I've built systems as a software engineer, managed them as a scrum master, shaped them as a product manager, and tested them as a quality assurance analyst. In every role I've played, I pride myself on my ability to understand the full scope of a problem and solve it.",
    "So what does that mean exactly? A client is struggling to figure out how to use Scrum and Jira, let me sit down with them and teach them how it works. When we haven't hired a C++ developer, let me figure out how to extend an open-source Bitcoin Wallet for our needs. An endpoint isn't working despite the developer saying otherwise, let me debug the apache logs to find the issue. The CEO wants a status update, let me generate a progress report based from the Jira project I've been managing.",
    "The technology stack matters less than understanding the problem. Whether it's Vue, React, Spring Boot, or wiring up a Raspberry Pi to a rotary phone, the question is always the same - how can I make someone's life better, in the timeframe that I'm given, in the most cost-effective way.",
