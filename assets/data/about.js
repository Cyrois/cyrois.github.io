    "What I've learned throughout my career after working across multiple industries with several different teams: it's all about adding value. I've built systems as a software engineer, managed them as a scrum master, shaped them as a product manager, and tested them as a quality assurance analyst. In every role I've played, I pride myself on my ability to understand the scope of a problem and solve it.",
    "So what does that mean exactly? A client is struggling to figure out how to use Scrum and Jira, let me sit down with them and teach them how it works so this does not become a blocker for the project. The CEO wants a status update, let me generate a progress report based from the Jira project I've been managing so they know what to expect. When we have yet to hire a C developer, let me figure out how we <i>want</i> to extend an open-source Bitcoin Wallet so we can hit the ground running when we do. All of these are examples are part of my day to day work to keep the projects moving forward and adding value for the end users.",
    "The technology stack matters less than understanding the problem. Whether it's Vue, React, Spring Boot, or wiring up a Raspberry Pi to a rotary phone, the question is always the same - how can I make someone's life better, in the timeframe that I'm given, in the most cost-effective way.",
